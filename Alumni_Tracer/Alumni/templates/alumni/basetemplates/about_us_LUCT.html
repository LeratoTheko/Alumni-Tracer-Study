        <h2>Mission</h2>
        <p>
            The mission of Limkokwing University's Tracer Study is to foster continuous engagement between the university and its alumni, ensuring a supportive network that aids in professional growth and development by connecting graduates with each other and with potential employers.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Vision</h2>
        <p>
            Our vision is to be a leading platform that bridges the gap
            between education and employment, transforming lives globally.
        </p>

        <h2>Objectives</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>To pin-point each graduate in order to derive statistics regarding the study.</li>
            <li>To derive from these statistics information that can help the university and other organizations better understand graduates as a critical currency to the economy of the country.</li>
            <li>To keep updated records to provide employers with a data-base of employable graduates.</li>
            <li>To create a data-base of companies established by Limkokwing Alumni.</li>
            <li>To estimate the contributions to the workforce and employment statistics and all other aspects of the working class.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Analysis</h2>
        <p>
            The structure of the Universityâ€™s Tracer Study is designed to categorize graduates based
            on their current employment status. Graduates are divided into annual reports for specific
            graduation years, ranging from 2011 to 2017. They are further categorized into the following
            groups:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Self-employed Students:</strong> These are students who have started their own companies, serving as a significant asset to Lesotho's economy.</li>
            <li><strong>Employed Students:</strong> They are working in various sectors, including industry leaders, government ministries, NGOs, and small to medium enterprises.</li>
            <li><strong>Unemployed Students:</strong> Those currently not employed.</li>
            <li><strong>Unavailable Students:</strong> Students who were not accessible during the study due to outdated contact information or unavailability.</li>
            <li><strong>Studying Students:</strong> Those pursuing further studies.</li>
            <li><strong>Deceased Students:</strong> Those who have passed away.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This analysis provides insights into the active participation of graduates in the economy
            and guides efforts to engage with alumni for data collection and networking purposes.
        </p>

        <h2>Tracer Study Project</h2>
        <p>
            The Tracer Study project is an initiative aimed at collecting data and insights
            about the career paths and experiences of graduates from educational institutions.
            By analyzing this data, we provide valuable information to both graduates and employers,
            facilitating better career opportunities and decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our platform offers various services such as alumni networking, job postings,
            skill development resources, and data analytics tools to empower both graduates
            and educational institutions in their career journeys.
